  "summary": "Define static members in inner classes without requiring static nested classes.",
  "explanation": "Before Java 16, only static nested classes could contain static members. Inner (non-static) classes couldn't have statics because they required an enclosing instance. Java 16 relaxes this restriction, allowing static fields, methods, and even nested types in inner classes.",
