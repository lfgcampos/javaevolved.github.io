summary: "Define static members in inner classes without requiring static nested classes."
explanation: "Before Java 16, only static nested classes could contain static members.\
  \ Inner (non-static) classes couldn't have statics because they required an enclosing\
  \ instance. Java 16 relaxes this restriction, allowing static fields, methods, and\
  \ even nested types in inner classes."
