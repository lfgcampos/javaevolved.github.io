summary: "Add method implementations directly in interfaces, enabling multiple inheritance\
  \ of behavior."
explanation: "Before Java 8, sharing behavior across unrelated classes required abstract\
  \ classes, which limited you to single inheritance. Default methods let interfaces\
  \ provide method implementations, so classes can inherit behavior from multiple\
  \ interfaces. This was essential for evolving the Collections API (e.g., List.forEach,\
  \ Map.getOrDefault) without breaking existing implementations."
