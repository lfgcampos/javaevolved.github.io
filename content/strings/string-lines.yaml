summary: "Use String.lines() to split text into a stream of lines without regex overhead."
explanation: "String.lines() returns a Stream<String> of lines split by \\n, \\r,\
  \ or \\r\\n. It is lazier and more efficient than split(), avoids regex compilation,\
  \ and integrates naturally with the Stream API for further processing."
