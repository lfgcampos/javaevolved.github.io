summary: "Create millions of lightweight virtual threads instead of heavy OS threads."
explanation: "Virtual threads are lightweight threads managed by the JVM, not the\
  \ OS. You can create millions of them without tuning thread pools. They're ideal\
  \ for I/O-bound tasks like HTTP calls and database queries."
