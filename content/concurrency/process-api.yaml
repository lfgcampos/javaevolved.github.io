oldCode: |-
  Process p = Runtime.getRuntime()
      .exec("ls -la");
  int code = p.waitFor();
  // no way to get PID
  // no easy process info
modernCode: |-
  ProcessHandle ph =
      ProcessHandle.current();
  long pid = ph.pid();
  ph.info().command()
      .ifPresent(IO::println);
  ph.children().forEach(
      c -> IO.println(c.pid()));
summary: "Inspect and manage OS processes with ProcessHandle."
explanation: "ProcessHandle provides PIDs, process info (command, arguments, start\
  \ time, CPU usage), parent/child relationships, and process destruction. No more\
  \ undocumented Process internals."
