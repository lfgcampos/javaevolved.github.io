  "oldCode": "ExecutorService exec =\n    Executors.newCachedThreadPool();\ntry {\n    exec.submit(task);\n} finally {\n    exec.shutdown();\n    exec.awaitTermination(\n        1, TimeUnit.MINUTES);\n}",
  "modernCode": "try (var exec =\n        Executors.newCachedThreadPool()) {\n    exec.submit(task);\n}\n// auto shutdown + await on close",
  "summary": "Use try-with-resources for automatic executor shutdown.",
  "explanation": "Since Java 19, ExecutorService implements AutoCloseable. The close() method calls shutdown() and waits for tasks to complete. No more manual try/finally shutdown patterns.",
