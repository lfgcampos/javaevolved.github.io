summary: "The new IO class provides simple, concise methods for console input and\
  \ output."
explanation: "Java 25 introduces the IO class (java.io.IO) as part of the implicitly\
  \ declared classes feature. It provides static methods like println(), print(),\
  \ readln(), and read() that replace the verbose combination of System.out and Scanner.\
  \ IO.readln(prompt) handles both prompting and reading in a single call. The class\
  \ is automatically available in compact source files and can be used in traditional\
  \ classes via import."

  desc: "New developers can do console I/O without learning Scanner, System.out, or\
    \ import statements."
