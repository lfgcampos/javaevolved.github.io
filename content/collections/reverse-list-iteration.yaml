      String element = it.previous();

summary: "Iterate over a list in reverse order with a clean for-each loop."
explanation: "The reversed() method from SequencedCollection returns a reverse-ordered\
  \ view of the list. This view is backed by the original list, so no copying occurs.\
  \ The enhanced for loop syntax makes reverse iteration as readable as forward iteration."
